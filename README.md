# Azure Governance & Cost Optimization (Student Subscription)

This repository is a record of a governance-focused Azure project that would be used in an Azure Student subscriptions. Rather than deploying the workloads as the initial step, it is preoccupied with setup of the governance controls during the initial stages so that cost efficiency, standardization and sustainability can be achieved over the long term.

The environment is also ready to accommodate future projects in a controlled and predictable manner by specifying rules at an early stage. This can be seen as an expression of real-life cloud practices such planning and governance are first made and then workloads are scaled.

This project employs Azure Policy and Azure Lab Services to have accountable consumption of the resources prior to the deployment of application resources.

## Objectives

- Manage-costs cloud in a student university with a limit on credit.  
- Avoid the unintended production of costly or improperly set up resources.  
- Impose uniformity across regions, compute and storage.  
- Make all resources well identified.  
- Construct a platform of long-term Azure.  

## Imposed Governance Controls.

### Allowed Virtual machine size SKUs.

This policy limits the creation of virtual machines to approved cost-efficient VM sizes that can be used in learning and student environments.

#### - Long-term impact  
This can be used to ensure that the cost of compute is predictable once workloads are deployed, and also avoids the over-sizing or over-cost VM SKUs used by future projects.

#### - Parameters  
There is a parameterized list of authorized VM sizes such that approved SKUs can be changed without the need to redefine the policy.

#### - Exclusions  
There were no additions in regards to exclusions since there were no prevailing workloads or system-managed resource groups during the assignment.

### Allowed Locations

This policy limits deployment of the resources to a predefined number of Azure regions which are secure, supported and inexpensive.

#### - Long-term impact  
This guarantees a stable place of deployment and prevents the accidental use of expensive or unsupported areas as projects increase.

#### - Parameters  
Parameters are allowed regions in order to bring flexibility and control.

#### - Exclusions  
Extra resources were not necessary since there was an absence of resources to begin with.

### Mandatory Resource Tagging

This policy is mandatory tagging that mandates the use of a Project tag on new created resources.

#### - Long-term impact  
Once workloads are deployed, tagging allows tracking ownership, cleaning up easier and conducting the cost analysis.

#### - Parameters and challenge encountered.  
Azure needs a tag name and tag value in policy definition. Actual tag values vary with individual projects and thus a place value (Required) was used. This meets the policy requirement and at the same time, it provides flexibility in tag values when creating a resource.

#### - Exclusions  
It was not put to the exclusion of any resources generated by the system since everything was created at the time of assignment.

### Network Interfaces without Public IP Addresses (Audit).

This policy performs audit of network interfaces related to public IP addresses to determine the possible internet exposure.

#### - Long-term impact  
This policy creates security risks with no creation of blockage post deployment, which promotes safe networking habits and ensures learning is flexible.

#### - Why Audit was chosen  
The mode of audit was chosen to ensure that learning workflows are not disrupted since the mode is visible.

#### - Exclusions  
There were no exclusions needed since there were no network resources during the time of assignment.

### Storage Accounts Limited by Allowed SKUs.

This policy will also limit the number of storage accounts that could be created to accepted cost-effective SKUs.

#### - Long-term impact  
With the growing data use, this guarantees the predictability of cost of storage and avoids a priori selection of high-tier storage.

#### - Parameters  
Parameters are defined as allowed storage SKUs so that the policy can be changed in future without redefining it.

#### - Exclusions  
There were no exclusions added because there were no system-controlled storage resources.

## Screenshot reference

### Lab Services Auto-Shutdown Configuration.

Once labs are actively used, this ensures resources are not left running unintentionally, significantly reducing wasted credits over time.

#### - Long-term impact  
Once the labs are in use, this will make sure that resources do not sit and run idle as this will save credits that would have been wasted in the long run.

## Current Status

Governance controls are used at this stage, prior to the application workloads being deployed. Policy compliance and cost management dashboards, are thus yet to show evaluated resources.

This is premeditated and expected. The compliance outcomes and cost information will automatically be filled in when future projects are rolled out even without the need to modify the current governance arrangement.

## Key Takeaway

The best thing that I learnt in this project is that it is always better to have a clean environment and set up governance at the initial stage. Creating rules early is a sure way to keep the future projects organized, secure, and low-cost without having to be manually corrected all the time.
