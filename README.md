# Azure Governance & Cost Optimization (Student Subscription)

This repository showcases a governance-first approach to working with Microsoft Azure, designed specifically for an Azure Student subscription. Instead of starting with application deployment, the focus is placed on establishing clear controls for cost management, standardization, and long-term sustainability.

By implementing these foundations early, the environment is prepared to support future projects in a structured, secure, and cost-aware manner. This mirrors how cloud environments are planned and managed in real-world professional settings.

The project primarily leverages Azure Policy and Azure Lab Services to encourage responsible resource usage and prevent common misconfigurations that can lead to unnecessary costs.
