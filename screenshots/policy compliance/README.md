This folder contains screenshots related to Azure Policy compliance evaluation.

These screenshots are used to demonstrate how assigned Azure policies are monitored and assessed once resources are deployed. Policy compliance results help identify whether resources follow defined governance rules or require review and remediation.

At the current stage of this project, no application workloads have been deployed. As a result, the policy compliance dashboard does not yet display evaluated resources. This is expected, as the governance framework was intentionally implemented before workload creation.

When future projects are added to the subscription, policy compliance results will automatically populate without requiring any changes to the existing policies.
